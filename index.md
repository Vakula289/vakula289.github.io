Welcome to my portfolio!  
I’m a Grad student in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford specializing in **robotics and autonomous systems**. I enjoy building in the **learning-based controls** and **perception** spaces.
This site highlights my **projects, research, and experience**. 

My interests largely lie in:

- **Controls and Optimization** — decision-making under uncertainty, convex optimization, optimal and learning-based control  
- **Computer Vision** — segmentation, pose estimation, real-time perception systems  
- **Medical Robotics** — surgical assistance, catheter navigation, human–robot collaboration  

Outside of coursework, I’ve worked on projects including **autonomous ground mobile navigation**, **navigation in lung during bronchoscopy**, **real-time segmentation on the Da Vinci Surgical Robot** and expanding the bounds of assistive tech.  

When I’m not building robotic systems, I enjoy sharing knowledge, mentoring, and thinking about how math and engineering can directly improve human health and safety.
