## Project Overview

Worked with the Monarch Systems team at Johnson & Johnson MedTech on analytics and optimization for bronchoscopy navigation workflows used in hospitals.

## Key Experience

- Analyzed hospital datasets from bronchoscopy procedures and designed metrics to reduce time-to-target in lung navigation
- Developed a learning-based prediction and recommendation framework leveraging multi-variable optimization
- Filed an invention disclosure & patent; achieved up to **96% improvement** over the existing clinical navigation pipeline in targeted evaluations

## Technical Implementation

- Data cleaning and feature engineering on clinical procedure logs and sensor traces
- Constructed predictive models to anticipate navigation targets and recommend next actions in the workflow
- Optimized pipeline via constrained multi-variable optimization and validated improvements on historical cases

## Technologies Used

- Python, pandas, scikit-learn
- Optimization toolkits and custom model evaluation code
- Clinical data handling and privacy-aware processing
