## Project Overview

This project develops an intelligent decision-making system for respiratory management in ICU settings using reinforcement learning and Markov Decision Process frameworks. The system optimizes ventilator policies for individual patients using real-world medical data.

## Key Achievements

- **Reinforcement Learning Framework** for ventilator optimization
- **Patient-specific policies** derived through Q-learning
- **MIMIC-IV dataset validation** with improved respiratory stability
- **Clinical applicability** with safety constraints

## Technical Approach

### Framework Design
- **MDP Modeling**: State-space design for patient respiratory status
- **Reward Function**: Balancing patient comfort and clinical outcomes
- **Safety Constraints**: Hard limits on ventilator parameters

### Algorithm Implementation
- **Q-Learning**: Policy optimization for discrete action spaces
- **State Representation**: Multi-dimensional patient vital signs
- **Action Space**: Ventilator pressure, volume, and timing parameters

## Results & Impact

The system demonstrates significant improvements in respiratory management efficiency and patient outcomes through personalized ventilator control policies.

## Technologies Used
