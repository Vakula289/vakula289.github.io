## Project Overview

Research internship under Dr. Homayoun Najjaran working on navigation and control of a Pioneer3Dx mobile robot using onboard Jetson TX2 hardware.

## Key Achievements

- Implemented closed-loop PID control for robot motion and integrated the system on Jetson TX2
- Integrated the robot with ROS and extended an in-lab ROS-hub; explored GTSAM and ORB-SLAM using multi-camera setups
- Generated point-cloud data for map creation providing ~85% scene coverage and produced stereo-camera outputs for localisation
