## Project Overview

Research project focused on vision-based path prediction and wearable motion estimation to support fall prevention and exoskeleton assistance.

Advised by Dr. Monroe Kennedy, Assistive Robotics and Manipulation Lab, Stanford University.

## Key Activities

- Detecting dynamic elements for a vision-based path prediction model mounted on a wearable device
- Investigating 3D pose estimation and point-cloud mapping for pedestrian tracking using RGB-D and tracking camera data
- Integrating the detection pipeline with a path-prediction system to optimize pedestrian trajectories in real-time
