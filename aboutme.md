Hi, Iâ€™m **Vakula Venkatesh** ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m pursuing my masster's at Stanford University with a focus on **Robotics & Autonomous Systems**. My interests lie in:

- **Controls and Optimization** â€” decision-making under uncertainty, convex optimization, optimal and learning-based control  
- **Computer Vision** â€” segmentation, pose estimation, real-time perception systems  
- **Medical Robotics** â€” surgical assistance, catheter navigation, humanâ€“robot collaboration  

Outside of coursework, Iâ€™ve worked on projects including **autonomous ground mobile navigation**, **navigation in lung during bronchoscopy**, **real-time segmentation on the Da Vinci Surgical Robot** and expanding the bounds of assistive tech.  

When Iâ€™m not building robotic systems, I enjoy sharing knowledge, mentoring, and thinking about how math and engineering can directly improve human health and safety.
